Afternoon Coffee
===
The product is hyper-local. It is a way for people in dense environments
discover who they might like to discuss a particular topic with on that
very day. Kind of like a flash meetup.

This is a work in progress. Eventually, users can authenticate through
Foursquare or Facebook, create a topic or join an existing one, choose a 
location and time, and then go have fun.
